# Shulker Rush 1.14
Shulker Rush 1.14 mini-game code

This update fixed some bugs and changed some mechanics of 1.12 version of the map:

1) Swords upgrades now work
2) Fireworks won't stack with each other until used
3) Shop rebalanced
4) New PvP mechanic from 1.9 update (No more spam clicking)
5) Changed the third "Magic Effects" upgrade to glowing (Instead of strength)
6) Armor upgrades now really work (In original map, there wasn't actually protection enchanment, it was only in item's lore)

Currently game in Russian, but I will translate it back to English soon.
